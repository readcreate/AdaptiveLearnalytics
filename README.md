The following code can help you get started with installing and using the package:

if (!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')`
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("readcreate/AdaptiveLearnalytics")
library(AdaptiveLearnalytics)
```

Run the following code for more information:

The example code for each function uses the dataset `mtcars`, which is built into R, and should hopefully run for you smoothly.
